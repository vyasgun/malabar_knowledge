      The **Malabar pit viper** (*Craspedocephalus malabaricus*) is a venomous pit viper species
      endemic to the Western Ghats of southwestern India. It inhabits moist forests,
      particularly near streams and waterfalls. It is a relatively small snake,
      usually growing to about 2 to 2.5 feet in length.
      The Malabar pit viper displays a wide range of color morphs, including green,
      brown, yellow, and even reddish hues, often with complex patterns that help
      in camouflage. It has a broad, triangular head, vertical pupils, and heat-sensing
      pit organs located between the eyes and nostrils, which are used to detect
      warm-blooded prey.
      These vipers are ambush predators that feed on frogs, lizards, birds,
      and small mammals. They are nocturnal and rely heavily on their camouflage
      and heat-sensing ability to hunt. Though venomous, they are generally shy
      and not aggressive toward humans unless provoked.
      The Malabar pit viper is ovoviviparous, meaning females give birth to
      live young rather than laying eggs. Its venom is hemotoxic, affecting blood
      and tissues, but bites are rarely fatal with prompt medical treatment.
